# CourseProjectG-CData
Course project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

To run the R script run_analisis.R you need to unzip the file *getdata-proyectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip* into your current working directory.
Then position into the *UCI HAR Dataset* folder.

Run the *run_analysis.R* script to get the *data_set.txt* file with the dataframe from step 5.

The CodeBook.md file brifely explains the data, variables from the data set in data_set.txt and mentions the transformations made to the original data to get there.
